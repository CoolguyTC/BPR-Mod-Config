**Questions and Answers:**
---
- Where do I put the files?

>Pretty much anywhere.
The program will ask you to input directories for different folders when started.

---
- How do I setup the vehicle mod folder?

>Within the folder you assigned as the 'vehicle mods' folder your mods should look like this:

>Where 'CAR NAME X' is the name of the modded car.
And each individual car folder should look like this:

>There should be 1-3 '.BIN' files in there from the car mod that you have downloaded.

---
- Is there going to be a version that isn't in the command line?

>Yes, but I want to get it complete first before I move it to a GUI based system.

---
- When is support for map mods coming?

>At some point. (hopefully)

---
- I still need help!
